# Galaxy Data storage.

This directory contains the residual data cubes that are to be used in searching for nebulous \[OIII] 5007 \AA{} emission lines.
The Planetary Nebulae minicubes are stored in galaxy data, under files that are labelled after each galaxy.
The list of x,y coordinates for detected sources will also be stored here.

The file structure will look as follows:
galaxy_data/FCC000_data/  or galaxy_data/NGC0000_data/
