# Config

This is the area where the configuration files are included: 

- dir_config.yaml controls the directories used for data reading and writing
- galaxy_info.yaml contains the information on each galaxy, including the Point Spread Function parameters, impostor indexes and mask paramters for areas that need to be ignored.

There are also included the filter bandpasses used for luminosity calculations.
