# Plotted figures

This file contains the figures returned from the plotting of either raw data or Gaussian fits (both 1D and 2D) to MUSE data.

## Recent plots
 - Added - Moffat2D and Gaussian2D plot figures:
    - From left to right:
        - selected AOI in Flux map (top left), with the same AOI in flux map but with the residuals > 3 rN removed (bottom left).
        - 2D Gaussian and Moffat fitted models to potential PNe (top middle), with the 2nd 2D Gaussian and Moffat plots (bottom middle).
        - Associated Radial plots, showing major outliers (top right), then showing outlier removal (bottom right).

This Process is used to both help confirm whether source is a PNe or not, as well as plot the 2D Gaussian and Moffat models that have been fitted to the selected sources.
