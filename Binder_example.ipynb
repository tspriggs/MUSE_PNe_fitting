    "To start the spaxel-by-spaxel fit for \\[OIII] emission lines in the residual data cube, we use the MUSE_spaxel_fit.py script. It is located in `scripts/pne_analysis/`. This script reads in the residual cube: `galaxy_data/FCCtest_data/FCCtestcenter_residual_cube.fits` and performs a spaxel by spaxel fit for the \\[OIII] 4959 5007 Å doublet. The detected PNe are saved in files that are ready for the next phase in PNe fitting. The script also saves plots that showcase the results of the spaxel-by-spaxel fit, including flux, signal to noise (A/rN) and highlighted potential PNe.\n",

You have now run both scripts, firstly for spaxel by spaxel fitting nebulous \\[OIII] 5007 \\AA{} emission lines, within residual (stellar continuum subtracted) MUSE data, detecting the presence of unresolved point sources in \\[OIII] 5007 Å. The second script then fits the sources and filters out sources that do not meet a set criteria. Those sources that pass this filer are then fitted with our novel 1D+2D modelling technique enclosed herein, see [Spriggs, T.
